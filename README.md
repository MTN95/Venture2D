### <div align="center">Brief Description of the Project </div>
   

This project was initially created in between semesters as a personal project.
Developed over a couple of weeks (not finished) as side project while pursuing my Computer Science studies,
Mostly to continue learning SDL2 and its extentions, and to learn a bit of physics with box2D.

The Game Plan
</div>

    An Action Adventure 2D Side Scroller Game, Runner Shooter Like.

    OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) library 
    Box2D library
    SpdLog Library

NOTE: Vec2D.h is my own implementation of a templated 2D vector class started this project with this,
But decided to use glm instead.

### <div align="center">Building from Source</div>


This project is primarily developed using Microsoft Visual Studio Community, and vcpkg to manage the libraries.

If you're working with a different IDE, you might need to adjust the setup to compile and build. 

This involves configuring the environment to match the dependencies and settings used in Visual Studio.

### <div align="center">Final Notes</div>

This project, while modest in size at approximately 3000 lines of code, is committed to the principles of open-source development.

There remains much work to bring this game to completion. Currently, it features just the fundamentals, yet it's on a promising path. i invite contributions!
